# Linux/ Raspberry Pi / Debian useful instructions

A lot of times, I end up searching for a how-to tutorial specific for the Raspberry Pi. From setting up WiFi to using bash, from freeing up space to reducing boot time etc., there are a lot of things that are worth noting down somewhere.

It would be a lot easier and better to gather this information in one place.

The **Wiki** contains some useful instructions for less-common, but very useful use-cases.
