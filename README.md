# A repo for getting used to the Raspberry Pi

A lot of times, I end up searching for a how-to tutorial specific for the Raspberry Pi. From setting up WiFi to using bash, from freeing up space to reducing boot time etc., there are a lot of things that are worth noting down somewhere.

It would be a lot easier and better to gather this information in one place. This repo, or more precise, the Wiki of this repo should fulfill that role. 

Check out the Wiki regarding all of these informations.
